    <h2>The Peregrine Falcon</h2>
        <p>I chose the Peregrine Falcon, because I've been a huge fan of birds since I was a kid.
            Specifically "Raptors", or Birds of Prey.
        </p>

        <p>I find them to be fascinating creatures. Several different species have various attributes
            that allow them to hunt in many different ways. As for the Peregrine Falcon in particular
            I have listed a few different techniques as well as phyiscal feats, that allow them to hunt
            they way they
        </p>

    <h2>Features Specific to this Raptor</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>They can dive at speeds up to 250 mph</li>
            <li>These speedsters have translucent eyelids</li>
            <li>This allows them to dive at thier target without blinking</li>
            <li>Special nasal cavaties in the beak allow less air flow</li>
        </ul>
